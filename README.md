# How it is work?
With GitHub Actions, the A.P.A-repo is cloned, and with a few lines of code, a fully static application list is automatically generated without JavaScript.

# What is this site?  
This site fetches APK files from their original sources and archives them on GitHub releases. Everything is done automatically using GitHub Actions. This ensures that all applications are unmodified APKs, so users don’t have to worry about whether they are authentic.

# Is archiving really necessary? 
Absolutely, for example, QuickSwitch.

# What is your goal?
Although we started as an APK archiving site, our goal is to become a major distribution center for apps and similar things. In other words, we won’t just share APKs.

# How can we report issues or send feedback? 
You can click the GitHub icon on the site and share your feedback through GitHub.
